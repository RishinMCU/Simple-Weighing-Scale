# Simple-Weighing-Scale
In this project i want a simple moderately accurate weighing scale So i have used a HX711 load cell amplifier module connected to a Atmega328-U (basically a arduino uno) running @8Mhz internal clock programmed using MiniCore from a an another Ardunio uno as ISP with No bootloader mode displaying the result on a 16*2 LCD

Dependency:
 HX711 libray (#include "HX711.h") from https://github.com/bogde/HX711
 MiniCore from https://github.com/MCUdude/MiniCore (Optional)
